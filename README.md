This project aims to support the development of a new aviation business line by providing three business recommendations based on thorough data analysis. The objective is to identify the lowest-risk aircraft makes and models for the company to consider for its new aviation ventures.

The presented analysis focuses on key variables such as aircraft make and model, fatalities, time of accidents and accident locations. By addressing missing data, interpreting and visualizing the information, the analysis seeks to offer data-driven insights.

The findings will help the company mitigate potential risks and make informed decisions about aircraft purchases, ensuring a safe and strategic entry into the aviation market.
##    Business Understanding
Which fligh purpose has the least risk? 
Which flight purpose has the highest market share? 
When and where should the business start?

## Data
We used a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board. 
This dataset includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023
about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the 
United States and international waters.

### Initial Dataset: 88889 rows, 31 columns
### Filtered Dataset: 18167 rows, 22 columns
